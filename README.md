# Deep Learning Tutorial (NPTEL-Based)

This repository contains a comprehensive 13-week tutorial series on Deep Learning, curated in alignment with the NPTEL course structure.
It includes 12 weeks of detailed presentations covering core NN concepts and 1 week of revision content, along with well-documented Python code examples for practical implementation.

## 📘 What’s Inside

- 🎓 Week-wise Presentations (PPTs)  
  Each week focuses on a specific concept in NN including:
  - MP Neuron and Perceptron
  - Sigmoid Neuron
  - Dimensionality Reduction (PCA and SVD)
  - Neural Network Training
  - Autoencoders
  - Train and Test Error
  - Convolutional Neural Network
  - Recurrent Neural Network

- 🧠 **Revision Week**  
  A final module consolidating the key takeaways and important formulas from all previous weeks.

- 💻 **Python Code Files**  
  Hands-on Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating each concept with clean, executable code and real datasets where applicable.
